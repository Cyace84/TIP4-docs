# Typical deployment

In this section we will explore through deploying the typical parts of the TIP4 standard.
This parts are represented by other NFT standards and are not alien to the NFT users but in this case we will learn how the distributed version of these features are deployed and used on TVM(Ton Virtual Machine) based blockchains.

::: danger
- It is crucial to exercise caution and carefully manage the numbers and amounts associated with the transactions in this section. Avoid simply copying and pasting the code without thorough review and understanding.

- Kindly be aware that you are signing a transaction on the mainnet (this is not a testnet).
