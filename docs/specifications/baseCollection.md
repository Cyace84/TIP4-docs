# Base Collection
The `BaseCollection` contract differs from the TIP-4_nCollection contract. In simple terms, the `BaseCollection` contract is implemented to consolidate the functionalities provided by the TIP-4_nCollection contracts into a single contract. On the other hand, the TIP-4_nCollection contracts are responsible for providing the specific logic for each part of the standard.

For example, when it comes to minting NFTs, the [TIP-4_1 collection](https://github.com/itgoldio/everscale-tip/blob/main/contracts/TIP4_1/TIP4_1Collection.sol) contract provides the functionality to prepare the initial values required for minting and deploying the NFTs. However, it is the `BaseCollection` contract that fetches this data and deploys the NFT contract.
