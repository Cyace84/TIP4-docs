# Base NFT
As explained earlier, a NFT contract is written to handle the logic of the TIP-4_nNFT contracts. Unlike the collection contract, the NFT contract does not require any additional functionality implementation. It simply feeds the constructor of the desired TIP-4_nNFT contract.

::: tip
For further reference on the implementation of the contracts, you can explore the [itgoldio](https://github.com/itgoldio/everscale-tip) repository to see how they are implemented. Please refer to the "How to Use Library" section for more detailed instructions. You can find it at [ how to use library ](https://github.com/itgoldio/everscale-tip#how-to-use-library).
