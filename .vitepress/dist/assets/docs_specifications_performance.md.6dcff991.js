On the other hand, the TIP-4_nCollection contracts are responsible for providing the specific logic for each part of the standard.</p><p>For example, when it comes to minting NFTs, the <a href="https://github.com/itgoldio/everscale-tip/blob/main/contracts/TIP4_1/TIP4_1Collection.sol" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">TIP-4_1 collection</a> contract provides the functionality to prepare the initial values required for minting and deploying the NFTs. However, it is the performance collection contract that fetches this data and deploys the NFT contract.</p><h2 id="nft" tabindex="-1">NFT <a class="header-anchor" href="#nft" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;NFT&quot;">​</a></h2><p>As explained earlier, a performance NFT contract is written to handle the logic of the TIP-4_nNFT contracts.

It simply feeds the constructor of the desired TIP-4_nNFT contract.</p><div class="tip custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">TIP</p><p>For further reference on the implementation of performance contracts, you can explore the <a href="https://github.com/itgoldio/everscale-tip" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">itgoldio</a> repository to see how they are implemented.
